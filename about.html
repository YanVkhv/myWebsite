	<p id="intro">I'm just a regular 29-year-old, born in Leuven. After graduating from highschool I wanted to study geography at university, mainly because geography was my best subject in school. I've always been interested in computers too, both hardware and software, but I once got terrible advice from a senior, which made me rethink taking ICT courses. After one year of Geography I realized that this wasn't the subject for me, especially the biology, chemistry and physics classes that came with it. I reoriented the year after and chose a bachelor in Sinology which I completed. After graduating we all had the opportunity to apply for a scholarship in either China or Taiwan. I chose Taiwan, studied Chinese for another 6 months and then got stuck there for 3 years doing translating work. Taiwan is also where I met my awesome girlfriend. Living in Taiwan is great and all, but it's not future-proof. Wanting a more stable life and safeguarding our future, I decided to follow my dream of becoming a developer and returning to Belgium.</p>

		<li>When you hear a melody play in the streets, it won't be an icecream truck but a garbage truck</li>
		<li>Taiwan is slightly bigger than Belgium, but has a population of more than 23 million people</li>
