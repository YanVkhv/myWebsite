	<h2>The idea</h2>
	<p>Have you ever wanted to sign up for a gym membership and get in shape? <br>I'm sure you have, and it probably went a little like this: <br>You're incredibly motivated the first few weeks, you hit the gym each day, slowly but surely you lose the drive and stop going entirely. <br>You signed up for a year and only end up going once or twice. <br>Or maybe you feel so intimidated by the fit girls and jacked dudes that you end up skipping gym sessions. <br>Wouldn't it be nice to have someone accompany you, motivate you and help you? <br>Not everyone can afford a 100&euro;/hour trainer, so why not help each other?</p>
	<h2>How it'll actually work</h2>
	<p>With the myGymBuddy&copy; app you can browse and swipe for friends with the same goals as you, meet up and hit the gym <em>together!</em></p>
	<p>Do you want to lose weight?<br>Find someone with the same weight goal, meet up and go to the gym <em>together!</em></p>
	<p>Do you want to increase your bench, squat or deadlift?<br>Find someone with the same PR's, motivate each other, spot each other and just go for that next all time high <em>together!</em></p>
	<p>Are you a scrawny kid looking to change your life for the better but are too intimidated to hit the weights?<br>Find someone with the same struggles and go <em>together!</em></p>
	<p>With the myGymBuddy&copy; app you will be able to track the progress of you and your friends, start chatting, share workouts, but most importantly, make new friends!</p></div>
